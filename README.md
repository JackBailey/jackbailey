## About me

I'm a website developer from the UK. I primarily work for a UK-based advertising agency but I work on a few side-projects when I have time.

The main of which is [Lynx](https://github.com/Lynx-Shortener/Lynx), a sleek, functional URL shortener, which I've developed and maintained since December 2022.

I started learning programming at 10 (2014), mostly in Python. Then I had a [bit of a go with C#](https://github.com/JackBailey?tab=repositories&language=c%23) when I was 16 (2020), but really settled with Website development in JavaScript at the start of 2021. I then freelanced from October 2021 to December 2022.

You can find my freelancing on my [Portfolio](https://jackbailey.dev), along with my side-projects which are also here, on my GitHub.
