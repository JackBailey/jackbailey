## About me

Hi, I'm Jack Bailey, I have too many hobbies and too little time but I'm a UK-based developer of a few projects on GitHub, freelancer, and full-time frontend developer. I also tinker with my homeserver, 3D printing & modelling, electronics and automation in my free time.

## How I got here

- In 2013, (when I was 9) I was introducted to Scratch to make simple games and puzzles in, which I loved. The following year I was shown Python which was even better.

- I continued to use Python, asking for harder tasks from the teacher, as well as making little text-based games outside of class.

- I was gifted a Raspberry Pi in 2016 which introduced me to Linux, which although it mainly limited to game server hosting and emulation, it opened me up to this crazy new world.

- In 2020 I picked up C# ready for my College course in Computer Science. At the start of 2021 I wanted a custom email domain, which led to a [personal portfolio website](https://web.archive.org/web/20210629114942/https://jackbailey.uk/) in WordPress. I then learnt HTML/CSS/JS to have more control over the website. In October the same year, I started freelancing. I then started full-time work at an agency in 2023.

My website development skills are fully self-taught for free from YouTube videos and a lot of trial and error, outside of an intro to HTML in 2018 or so (which I didn't really take a liking to), and a bit of help from my Dad setting up WordPress.
