## About me

Hi, I'm Jack Bailey, I have too many hobbies and too little time but I'm a 19 year old developer of a few projects on GitHub, freelancer, and full-time frontend developer. I also tinker with my homeserver, 3D printing & modelling, electronics and automation in my free time.

You can view some of my work on GitHub or my [portfolio](https://jackbailey.dev/), and get in contact with me [here](https://jackbailey.dev/contact).

## How I got here

  Started to learn Python in school after I loved the logical approach of Scratch, I then continued learning at home by creating games such as text-based adventures. I continued to solely use Python over the next 6 or 7 years, getting into scripting to simplify tasks, and later, API usage.

  Gifted a Raspberry Pi 3B for Christmas, I started playing around with Linux, specifically debian-based distros such as Raspbian and Ubuntu. I played around with a few projects such as Kodi, RetroPie and Minecraft server hosting.

  I purchased my first Desktop PC, this allowed me to work on programming projects much easily and more often, as well as play games of course.

  Covid hit soon after starting of College, leaving me with plenty of free time to work on projects and build up my skillset. Picked up some C#, creating CLI and desktop apps, which I liked but didn't completely connect with it.

  I wanted my own email domain, so I purchased jackbailey.uk, and some hosting. This hosting included website hosting and WordPress. Out of curiosity I played around with WordPress a bit to make a [passable site](https://web.archive.org/web/20210629114942/https://jackbailey.uk/). I enjoyed this but not WordPress (without using paid-plugins at least). So I learnt HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make my own site from scratch. Learning from YouTube and other free online resources I repeatedly made sites, improving time after time, until I was confident enough to start freelancing in October 2021.

  I continued freelancing, for a few smaller software companies and individuals. I also experimented with full-stack development, creating a small side-business called [Cryptic](https://github.com/CrypticRip) - an online marketplace, oficially reselling products with a focus on providing flexible payment methods.

  I also got more into system administration and networking, managing several virtual servers and a homeserver, which remains one of my top hobbies today.

  I started full-time work at a UK-based advertising agency as a frontend developer, where I continue to work today. I also started working on [Lynx](https://github.com/Lynx-Shortener/Lynx), a sleek, functional URL shortener, which I've developed and maintained since December 2022.
