## About me

I'm a Frontend website developer from the UK.

I've always loved programming, ever since I started to use Scratch (I know) when I was 10 I've loved the flow of programming and creating impressive projects that I'm proud of and I can show off.

I originally chose Python as my primary programming language due to starting to learn it at 11 in Secondary School and although it served me very well for 6 years as my focus shifted to developing websites and programs in late 2020 (when I started college), rather than CLI games and scripts, I picked up C# and JavaScript.

I got on better with these, my program development focus was short lived, only creating a few programs, some of which [I open-sourced](https://github.com/JackBailey?tab=repositories&language=c%23). However I really took a liking to website development.

Originally starting with Wordpress and hating it, I started learning HTML/CSS to recreate my [original WordPress site](https://web.archive.org/web/20221015034242/https://old.jackbailey.uk/). I then created several iterations of my portfolio which you can find [here](https://github.com/JackBailey/Portfolio).

In October 2021 I started freelancing which I continued until January 2023, after which I started as a website developer for an advertising and marketing company.
